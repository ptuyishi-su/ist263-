                <p>India is home to over two-thirds of the world's wild tiger population. And while you might've seen captive Bengal tigers at zoos all over the world, seeing one roaming wild in its own terrain is an experience unlike any other.

                <p>Hundreds of vivid blue houses line the labyrinthine alleyways of Jodhpur, the blue city. Saris in a rainbow of colors darting through crowded spice bazaars offer a glimpse into real India. The majestic Mehrangarh Fort towers over the wonderful city. This sprawling network of Rajasthan's most gorgeous palaces is one of India's most complicated. The fort's museum houses an amazing collection of armaments, clothes, and artwork from the Marwar kingdom's glory days, and the grand gates bore the signs of numerous failed sieges.

                <h3>Pink Capital of Jaipur</h3>
                <p>Some of Rajasthan's most spectacular palaces can be seen in the pink capital of Jaipur. Rajasthan's main city is one of India's most fascinating cultural sites, standing as a testimony to a bygone period. When the Maharaja ordered it in 1876, all of the city's buildings were painted the same shade of terracotta pink, the color of hospitality. The City Palace in Jaipur is now a fantastic terracotta maze where visitors can lose themselves for hours.

                <p> Play Holi with the locals
                One of the main reasons India is known as the "Land of Colors" is because of Holi. Holi, an ancient Indian festival marking the arrival of spring, is celebrated every year during the traditional Indian month of Phalguna (between February and March). Holi, a festival of fun, frolic, and many colors has become one of India's most popular cultural exports and is now celebrated by Indian and foreign communities all over the world. However, to truly appreciate the essence of this enthralling festival, one must travel to India.

            <h3>Fire-Walking</h3>
            <p>Thimithi aka the fire-walking tradition of Tamil Nadu
                Every year during the months of October and November, a festival honors Draupadi Amman, the wife of the five Pandava brothers from the Mahabharata. While walking on a sheet of burning coal, male devotees carry a pot of milk or water on their heads for balance. The fact that they engage in this practice demonstrates their complete dedication to their beliefs.
