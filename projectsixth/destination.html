                <div><p>India is home to over two-thirds of the world's wild tiger population. And while you might've seen captive Bengal tigers at zoos all over the world, seeing one roaming wild in its own terrain is an experience unlike any other. The best reserves and national parks to go on a tiger safari in India include Corbett National Park, Ranthambore National Park, and the Pench Tiger Reserve.</p>

                <div><p>Hundreds of vivid blue houses line the labyrinthine alleyways of Jodhpur, the blue city. Saris in a rainbow of colors darting through crowded spice bazaars offer a glimpse into real India. The majestic Mehrangarh Fort towers over the wonderful city. This sprawling network of Rajasthan's most gorgeous palaces is one of India's most complicated. The fort's museum houses an amazing collection of armaments, clothes, and artwork from the Marwar kingdom's glory days, and the grand gates bore the signs of numerous failed sieges.

                <div><p>Some of Rajasthan's most spectacular palaces can be seen in the pink capital of Jaipur. Rajasthan's main city is one of India's most fascinating cultural sites, standing as a testimony to a bygone period. When the Maharaja ordered it in 1876, all of the city's buildings were painted the same shade of terracotta pink, the color of hospitality. The City Palace in Jaipur is now a fantastic terracotta maze where visitors can lose themselves for hours.

                <div><p>Khajjiar, sometimes known as the 'Mini Switzerland of India,' is a magnificent mountain range that rises to a height of over 1981 meters (6500 feet). It is a wonderful destination for nature enthusiasts, with dense woodland, swaths of green meadows, and stunning views of snow-capped mountains. The Kalatop Wildlife Sanctuary, which is home to unusual flora and animals, the Khajji Naga Temple, which dates back to the 12th century, and the Khajjiar Lake, which is positioned at 1920 meters and encircled by hills, grasslands, and deodar woods, are all must-see sites.

                <div><p>The Kaas Plateau, a UNESCO World Biodiversity Site, is another ethereal wonder. With over 850 varied and unusual flowering plant species, it attracts visitors. In the months of August and September, when these flowering plants are in full bloom, their beauty is unrivaled. Because it is relatively unknown, you may enjoy this beauty in complete peace and breathe in the clean, unpolluted air.

            <div><p> Play Holi with the locals
                One of the main reasons India is known as the "Land of Colors" is because of Holi. Holi, an ancient Indian festival marking the arrival of spring, is celebrated every year during the traditional Indian month of Phalguna (between February and March). Holi, a festival of fun, frolic, and many colors has become one of India's most popular cultural exports and is now celebrated by Indian and foreign communities all over the world. However, to truly appreciate the essence of this enthralling festival, one must travel to India.

            <div><p>Timothy aka the fire-walking tradition of Tamil Nadu
                Every year during the months of October and November, a festival honors Draupadi Amman, the wife of the five Pandava brothers from the Mahabharata. While walking on a sheet of burning coal, male devotees carry a pot of milk or water on their heads for balance. The fact that they engage in this practice demonstrates their complete dedication to their beliefs.
